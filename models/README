To make the collada models here:

Created in blender 2.49b. Move center point using F9 - Center cursor to the origin point. Apply visual transform to objects (select all, ctrl-a) - sometimes need to do this...
Exported in blender 2.68 as collada, before this select all and do Ctrl - a Apply position. Must do this part in 2.68.
